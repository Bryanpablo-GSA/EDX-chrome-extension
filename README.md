You can add also add the extension in development mode (though this won't work with GSA devices):

- Download and extract [zip file](https://github.com/GSA/EDX-chrome-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Open Chrome to `chrome://extensions/`
- Make sure "Developer mode" is checked
- "Load unpacked extension..."
- Open the extracted directory
